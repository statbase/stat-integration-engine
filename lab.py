Integration
    Source: <Kolada>
    Output: <List of datablocks for given source, could be a selection of 
    things available on Kolada

Steps:
1. Get data, normalise and save to db
2. Create admin tool with which one can manipulate and query data from the database
    Perhaps this as well could be the same monolith? To make things easier..
    Just make sure to decouple from integration steps...
3. Create simple client (React) with which one can utilise the API
